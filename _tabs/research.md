I am a PhD student and applied health economist in the Department of Economics
at SMU. While, all of my research fits in the health economics and applied  
microeconometrics, my current research projects are: 

* **Hidden in Plain Sight: Prevalence and Impact of ADHD Underdiagnosis**, _working paper, draft available upon request_
  + While diagnostic errors are prevalent throughout health and mental health fields, little is known about their long-term consequences. Here, I assess the long-term education and labor market effects of missed ADHD diagnoses. Doing so is challenging for two reasons. First, a person's true ADHD status is unobserved; only their diagnosed status is known. Second, even if diagnostic errors are observed, they are likely akin to non-classical misclassification errors and therefore endogenous. Using data from Add Health I extend on and use the partial observability model developed in Nguimkeu, Denteh, and Tchernis (2019). I assess the effect of true ADHD status and the probability of a missed diagnosis on adult education and labor market outcomes. The model finds striking results. The first is that the model predicts ADHD is underdiagnosed. Second, large diagnostic gaps exist based on the lines of sex, race, ethnicity, and parental socioeconomic status. Third, the model predicts that both ADHD and a missed diagnosis are highly detrimental for human capital development, and that large improvements can be made with correct diagnosis. These results provide evidence of viscous intergenerational cycles in which inequity in mental health care drives and is driven by socioeconomic inequities.

* **Political Morality Cycles**_, with Daniel Millimet, working paper, draft available upon request_
  + Geographic inequities in mortality rates in the US are quite pronounced and growing. Yet, the causes of this inequality are not understood. Recently, the focus has been on the role of {\it place}. Formally, what is the relationship between location-specific factors and mortality inequality across space and demographic groups? We explore the importance of politics as a {\it place}-specific factor contributing to mortality inequality. Specifically, we test for the existence of {\it partisan mortality cycles} using panel data on counties from 1968--2016. Previous research has demonstrated the existence of so-called partisan business cycles, whereby economic outcomes vary according to the political regime in power. Here, we assess whether there are systematic differences in mortality depending on the political party or ideology of those in power at the federal and state levels. Overall, we confirm the existence of partisan mortality cycles. In particular, mortality is lower in counties governed by more liberal political regimes; we find mixed results when analyzing political party. We also assess heterogeneity along several dimensions, finding important differences over time, by race and sex, and across the mortality distribution. Importantly, we find no evidence of partisan mortality cycles since 2000. 

* **Stigma in Mental Health Care: How Peer Networks Affect Student Decisions to Seek Help**_, with Shuo Qi, in progress_
  + Mental health is increasingly being recognized as a public health crisis. However, mental illness is more likely than other physical health issues to go untreated. This is particularly true in the case of adolescent mental health, where there has been growing concerns of the epidemic of depression and anxiety among teenage students. One potential barrier in adolescents receiving mental health care could be the stigmatization from peers. Normalizing the treatment of mental health care through counseling among children can have important consequences. We assess the role of peer networks on the selection into mental health care, using the Add Health data. We do this by introducing a stigma effect and mental health care selection into a network model on child cognitive and social capital development.
