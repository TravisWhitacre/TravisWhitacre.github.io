I am a PhD student and applied health economist in the Department of Economics
at SMU. While, all of my research fits in the health economics and applied microeconometrics, my current research projects are: 

* **Hidden in Plain Sight: Prevalence and Impact of ADHD Underdiagnosis**, _Job market paper, draft available upon request_
  + While diagnostic errors are prevalent throughout health and mental health fields, little is known about their long-term consequences. Here, I assess the long-term education and labor market effects of undiagnosed ADHD during childhood. Doing so is challenging for two reasons. First, a child's true ADHD status is unobserved; only their diagnosed status is known. Second, even if diagnostic errors are observed, they are likely akin to non-classical misclassification errors and therefore endogenous. To overcome these challenges, I provide a theoretical model of diagnosis to understand the sources of diagnostic error. The theory maps clear causal mechanisms in which genetic characteristics passed on from the parent affects true ADHD status, ADHD status and demographic characteristics affect the probability of diagnosis, and all three of these (ADHD, diagnosis, and demographic characteristics) determine adult labor market and education outcomes.
  +
  + The model is then estimable by extending the partial observability model developed in Nguimkeu et al. (2019) through a bivariate probit model. Using data from ADD Health, I am able to predict true ADHD status and the probability of a false negative diagnosis for a national sample of adolescents using detailed data on genetic, hereditary, demographic, and socioeconomic characteristics. The partial observability model uses the fact that, under the assumption of no false positives, an observed diagnosis can only happen if a child truly has ADHD and the child is diagnosed with ADHD correctly. Thus, using data only on observed diagnosis, the model is able to recover determinants of both true ADHD status and receiving a correct diagnosis. This results in predicted probabilities of ADHD, undiagnosed ADHD, and conditional undiagnosed ADHD for every individual within the sample.
  +
  + The analysis has striking results. First, I find that ADHD is underdiagnosed, in which there is a 0.78 conditional probability of a false negative, or going undiagnosed given true predicted ADHD status. Second, large diagnostic gaps exist based on sex, race, ethnicity, and parental socioeconomic status. The racial gaps cannot be fully explained by socioeconomic background. Third, I find that both ADHD and a false negative diagnosis are highly detrimental for human capital development, and that large improvements can be made with correct diagnosis. I conduct an empirical monte carlo to test for the robustness of these results for varying rates of false positives.
  +
  + These results provide evidence of viscous intergenerational cycles in which inequity in mental health care is driven by and reinforces socioeconomic inequities. To further explore these results, I consider which types of school and neighborhood characteristics might drive higher school level false negative rates. With merged common core data, I use bivariate OLS and LASSO methods used in Finkelstein et. al (2016) and find that it is primarily economic neighborhood characteristics as well as racial and ethnic demographics which drive higher school level false negative rates. 

* **Partisan Mortality Cycles**_, with Daniel Millimet, Submitted for publication, draft available upon request_
  + Geographic inequities in mortality rates in the US are pronounced and growing. Yet,
    the causes of this inequality are not understood. Recently, the focus has turned to the
    role of place-specific factors. Here, we explore the importance of politics as a place-specific
    factor contributing to mortality inequality. Specifically, we test for the existence
    of {\it partisan mortality cycles} using panel data on counties from 1968-2016. We confirm
    the existence of partisan mortality cycles, finding lower mortality in counties governed
    by more liberal political regimes; the evidence regarding political party is mixed.
    Several sources of heterogeneity are also uncovered.

* **The Labor Market Returns of Adolescent Mental Healthcare**_, with Shuo Qi, Working paper, draft available upon request_
  + Mental health is increasingly being recognized as a public health crisis. However, mental illness is more likely than other physical health issues to go untreated. This is particularly true in the case of adolescent mental health, where there has been growing concerns of the epidemic of depression and anxiety among teenage students. One potential barrier in adolescents receiving mental health care could be the stigmatization from peers. Normalizing the treatment of mental health care through counseling among children can have important consequences. We assess the role of peer networks on the selection into mental health care, using the Add Health data. We do this by introducing a stigma effect and mental health care selection into a network model on child cognitive and social capital development. We then estimate the child's labor market returns from receiving mental healthcare as an adolescent, given their cognitive and social capital. We find a strong financial return of counseling in adolescence which diminishes as a child's initial social or cognitive capital grows, or if their mental health worsens.
