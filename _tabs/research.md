I am a PhD student and applied health economist in the Department of Economics
at SMU. While, all of my research fits in the health economics and applied
microeconometrics, my current research projects falls under the following
themes:

* **Linking ADHD and mental health diagnostic errors to development of education
capital and labor market outcomes**
  + ADHD is a lifelong mental health disorder which is documented to have significant
    effects on education attainment, labor market outcomes and risky behaviors. The
    current literature provides evidence that it is underdiagnosed, especially among
    non-white and female populations. I currently am working on understanding the
    relation between an individual having ADHD but going undiagnosed (a false negative)
    and their future economic and educational attainment outcomes. I am using
    longitudinal data from the restricted Add Health data set which follows the same
    cohort from 1995-2017.
  + In this project I extend a theoretical model from Chen Jr et al. (2019) to determine
    the probability of a false negative being derived from variables which *cause ADHD*
    and variables which *correlate with a diagnosis*. I use a both a Genome Wide Association
    Study (GWAS) and random forest approach to determine which genetic variables
    to choose in the causal portion of the model. I then use a partial observability model
    to derive the probability of a false negative for each individual in the data set
    and then use a probit model to see the effect of a higher probability of a false
    negative on educational attainment and financial outcomes. Preliminary results
    indicate that as the probability that an individual is a false negative rises,
    their probability of higher education attainment and probability of both being
    employed and being in a higher income bracket falls significantly.

* **Demographic health and mortality trends in the US based on political ideology
and sexual orientation**
  + I am currently working on two projects within the fields of health and economic
  demography.
  + The first project, joint with Prof. Daniel L. Millimet, explores the intersection
  between mortality trends and the ideology of state and federal political administrations
  in the US. We motivate the study through Chetty et. al (2016)'s paper over the
  association of income and life expectancy within the United States. We use CDC
  mortality data from 1968-2016 and ideology data from DWNominate and state ideology
  data from Richard C. Fording. We explore differences in mortality associated with
  the political ideology of administrations in power and assess heterogeneity by
  race, gender and mortality cause.
  + The second project, join with Prof. Wookun Kim, is in a preliminary phase and
  will take advantage of the longitudinal Add Health data to explore health trends
  among the LGBTQ+ community from the mid-90s to 2017. In particular, we plan to
  observe these trends pre and post landmark state and federal legislation/rulings,
  such as the 2015 supreme court case Obergefell v. Hodges.
