I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Department of Economics at SMU. My primary fields are Health Economics and Applied Microeconometrics, but my research also intersects with the Economics of Education and Economic Demography. I have a specialized interest in children's health and development, and the importance of mental healthcare in childhood on a child's human capital development.
