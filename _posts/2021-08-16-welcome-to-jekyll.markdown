I am a PhD student in the Department of Economics at SMU. My primary fields are Health Economics and Applied Microeconometrics, but my research also intersects
with the Economics of Education and Economic Demography. I am currently a third year student, so be on the lookout for a working draft of a few of my current
projects soon!
